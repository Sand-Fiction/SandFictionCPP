The Lovers

Before the Festival

Selene:

Bubble above head:
Just what am I supposed to do ...

Dialogue:

Oh, Cleo! I am sorry, I didn't see you there.
Are you getting ready for the festival as well? 

This time, I sewed my dress myself.
I hope he... Ah nevermind.

1. Are you bothered by something?
2. I can not sew.

1- A
Oh - No it's ... You noticed?
Well, I guess I could tell you, since you wouldn't share it. Right?

1.1 Who would I share with?
1.2 Why would I not share?
1.3 I will not share. 

1.1 - A
True, you don't have many friends ... Oh, I am sorry!
I don't have many friends either, but I hope -

I hope that this evening, I will have a boyfriend.
You see, I really, really like Helios.

But I don't know if I should tell him ...
What do you think?

1.1.1 Share your feelings with him.
1.1.2 You should not share.

1.1.1 A
Truly? You truly think so?
Oh stars, but I am not prepared!

Breath, Selene, deep breaths. Alright, I will tell him.
As soon as the festival starts, I will tell him.

Thank you Cleo.

Dialogue Ends
New Bubble: Oh stars, how do I tell him?

1.1.2
*sighs* You are probably right.
It would be so embarassing if it was just me.

Haha, I am so stupid right?
So ... stupid ...

Dialogue ends
New bubble: What was I thinking ...

1.1.3
I knew I could trust you!
It's about Helios. You know, Helios, that works on the fields?

He is so tall, so gallant, so *sighs* perfect.
Oh, sorry! Well, as you saw, I really, really like Helios.

1.1.3.1 You do?
1.1.3.2 I see.

1.1.3.1 A 
Of course I do! 
At least I think I do ...

Oh, Cleo, I was so sure! But now I am not ...
Maybe I should think some more.

Or do I tell him?
What do you think?

1.1.3.1.1 Just tell him
1.1.3.1.2 Thinking sounds good

1.1.3.1.1 A
Truly? You truly think so?
Oh stars, but I am not prepared!

Breath, Selene, deep breaths. Alright, I will tell him.
As soon as the festival starts, I will tell him.

Thank you Cleo.

Dialogue Ends
New Bubble: Oh stars, how do I tell him?

1.1.3.1.2 A
Oh... Yes, you are right.
You can never be sure enough in such things.

Thank you Cleo. I wouldn't want to make a fool out of me.

Dialogue Ends
New Bubble: How stupid of me ...

1.1.3.2 A
But I don't know if I should tell him ...
What do you think?

1.2 A
Because I asked you not to?
Maybe I can't tell you after all ...

*sighs* I will see you later on the festival Cleo.

Dialogue ends
New Bubble: What should I do?

.

2- A
I - I can teach you! Oh, but you are leaving so soon ...
Maybe Claude could teach you. Is he not coming with you? 

He even advised me with dress, saying I should accentuate my -
Y-You know, I think that doesn't matter right now. 

You wanted to get ready right? 
And I also still have to - well, to think.

1. Are you bothered by something?
2. Have fun thinking.

1-A

2-A
I - I will? See you later Cleo. *sighs*

On Festival if together:

Bubble: So this is love ...

Oh Cleo, this must be the most beautiful evening of my live!
I wish you would stay, I would definetly invite you to our wedding!

Haha, maybe I am a bit rash.
...

Do you think he likes children?

On Festival if alone:
Bubble: Just one more glass ...

Cleoooo! *hick*
Why don't you also get yourself a glass? *hick*

On us- single women! *hick*
Who needs beautiful, nice, wonderful - *hick*

*sighs* Helios ...



Helios - Before Festival Dialogue

Ya Cleo!
What are you doing here? 

Also hoping for a make-over from the great Claude?
He had me in his claws the last hours or so. 

But seems like I look good enough now, don't you think?

	A1 Good enough for what?
	A2 I think so.
	A3 I don't think so.

A1: Good enough for what?

Well ... It is supposed to be a secret, but if everything goes as planned -
I want to tell Selene how I feel. You know, romantically.

Hah, but I've never been good with such things. I am much better suited for simple things. Tilling, for example.
I really don't want to scare her. She's so tiny.

What do you think? Do I have a chance?

A1.1: Yes!
A1.2: No, absolutely not!

A1.1: Wow, you seem very sure of yourself. I should follow your example and go to Selene!
*gulp* Yes, I can do this.

Thank you so much Cleo!

A 1.2: H- How can you be so certain? Have you talked to her?
       No, don't answer. I don't want to know.

	   *Sigh* I guess I should apologize to Claude then. All of his work wasted for nothing.
	   And he was so excited.
